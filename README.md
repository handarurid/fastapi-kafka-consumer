# fastapi-kafka-consumer
This project shows how to use a Kafka Consumer inside a Python Web API built using FastAPI. This can be very useful for use cases where one is building a Web API that needs to have some state, and that the state is updated by receiving a message from a message broker (in this case Kafka).  One example of this could be a ML Web API, that is serving requests for performing inferences according to the current model. Often, this model will be updated over time as the model gets retrained according to a given schedule or after model/data drift job has been executed. Therefore, one solution could be to notify the Web API by sending a message with either the new model or some metadata that will enable the API to fetch the new model.
